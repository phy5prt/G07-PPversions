PP Repo is the more graphical version though still has the sun removed and grass
and various other aspects

PPLV1 is the lighter version with quarter the map size

Scripts are in assets then scripts folders

if using the files then you will ideally want to use unity 2017.4.9

In the PPLV1 folder at the bottom is the testpedalpirates.exe

this version at time of writing is the only built version I've been working with

The arduino file in pplv1 has the script for the arduino in it
the arduino is used as a controller rather than testing by pedaling eight bikes
